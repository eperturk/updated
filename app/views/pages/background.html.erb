<h4>Meet the Co-Founders of College Quest Advising</h4>
<p class="lead">CQA History</p>
<p>
	Renée and Mary met over 30 years ago as undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and were active members of the national fraternity, Alpha Chi Omega. With similar professional paths in the field of Higher Education and specifically the Division of Student Affairs for a combined 25+ years of experience, we had a strong interest in forming a small boutique business to assist high school students and their families in our respective communities, with the very complicated process of college admissions.  We worked together for several years, combining our expertise and knowledge about higher education to develop a program that we believe will help our clients manage the best possible outcomes for their college admissions.  We are excited to work with each student, to make this process, which at times can seem quite overwhelming, simple, easy and fun for you and your student! Take a moment to read our article, “This is Not Your Mother’s Application Process Anymore” which was featured in the Northshore Community Magazine, June 2012, to learn more about our philosophy.

	The CQA college advisors regularly visit college campuses and college fairs greeting college admissions representatives and assessing college campuses. The advisors consistently stay current on college admissions and higher education trends by regularly attending professional admissions conferences and programs.
