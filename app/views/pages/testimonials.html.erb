I want to thank you again for all the help you have given me this past year. The college application process is so hectic that I don’t think I would have ever survived it without your guidance, (and I definitely wouldn’t have gotten into UPenn)! You really took a lot of stress out of the process for me and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate that. <br />

Thank you, thank you, thank you for all of your hard work with our daughter, Ali. The college application process was scary to us and you made it manageable. Your help lead Ali to recognize all of her potential and helped the many colleges see her strengths. You do your work so gracefully and naturally-that is truly a gift. Please know and remember the difference you made in Ali’s life and therefore in our lives, too.
We are so grateful to you.<br />

Our daughter was overwhelmed with the college process. CQA helped her to break it down and feel more comfortable. The last thing our daughter wanted was advice from her parents...this is where CQA was most valuable.  They were able to relate to her well and our daughter listened.  By the end of the process her self-esteem had risen and she was excited about going to college. We are forever grateful to CQA.<br />

College Quest Advising helped ease my stress through the college process. Thanks to them, I was able to stay organized and ahead of the game. I do not know where I would have been without them. I am excited to attend UCLA this upcoming year.<br />

We could not have gotten through this process and to this point without Renée Serrano and College Quest Advising. At first, the whole undertaking seemed so overwhelming and daunting, but with Renee's help and guidance, and constant reassurance, our daughter stayed on track, focused and motivated. Ultimately, she was accepted to wonderful university that is the best fit for her. We would recommend College Quest Advising to anyone looking to get the most out of the college application experience. <br />

Renée made attending my dream school possible. She made the process so much less stressful and made sure I took full advantage of all my strengths throughout the application process. Renée made sure I was prepared for everything from college visits, essays, and interviews. I am so thankful that she helped me gain acceptance to every school that I thought were completely out of my reach.<br />

When it came time for fourth child to begin the college search and application process, we knew we needed some assistance. Our work schedules, combined with Caroline’s school, athletic and own work schedule, would not allow for proper research, guidance and decision-making. Well, our prayers where answered when we began to work with Renee Serrano, and CQA.
Starting back in Caroline’s junior year, Renee worked diligently with our daughter to map out a time line and game plan. It was not an easy task for Renee, but here we are almost 2 years later packing Caroline’s bags to UCLA! A monumental acceptance, made easier by Renee and CQA.  Thorough, professional and successful are just a few superlatives we can say about Renee’s work!<br />

What a perfect way to take some of the stress out of the college process for our son and us. The best part was that by September of senior year, our son had 90% of his application done and could put his efforts where they belonged which was into getting good grades!<br />

The college application process is nothing but stressful. However, when you’re working with Renee, she has a way to make you feel like you have everything under control.  Without Renee, I do not think my college application experience would have been as smooth. She was always on top of everything and helped me with my essays, applications, and final decisions. Renee was there every step of the way, and had an answer for every question. Her brilliant and creative ideas made me feel more confident and prepared. All of our hard work paid off when I was accepted into my dream school. Thank you Renee for everything!  <br />

I don’t think I have properly thanked you for your tremendous help in my college process. I am extremely happy with my choice to attend Northeastern. I couldn’t have gotten to where I am without you-you’ve made a difference in my life path and I am forever grateful.<br />

We are truly grateful to Mary and College Quest Advising for theprofessional and personal service we all received, especially in the current environment of college applications. Today, the process is completely different and much more complex than back in our days of the 1980’s. We could not begin to guide our daughter without the pro-active, up-to-date, and detailed advice of CQA. Having another adult, not to mention a true expert in the field, providing one-on-one accountability and encouragement to our daughter was a gift. Most importantly, she ended up at her dream school and it fits her perfectly. <br />
